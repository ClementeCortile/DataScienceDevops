# Deploy models faster with Data Science DevOps
Hello. This is the repo for all the content relating to my session "Deploy models faster with Data Science DevOps". If you have attend this session before then you have my thanks. If you have any questions, or you need support. Please let me know.  

I am on a personal mission to educate Data Scientists on best-practices from engineering. When I interview Data Scientists I will ask them about a model they built which had a benefit. I will then ask how they deployed it. This is often met with black looks and hushed mentioned that either the model was never deployed or it was deployed by the data engineering team. Heed my advice <b> learn how to deploy a model </b>. It is not enough to be able to write models anymore. The unicorns are on the rise! 

# Navigating this repo
You will find all the slides available and all of the models. We will be using Azure DevOps online for a lot of the talk. I will try to upload as much of that content as possible. 

# Today's Abstract
As Data Scientists we are great at machine learning, statistical modelling, visualising data and using data to tell a story. What are we not so good at? A lot of the core skills required in traditional software development. If you answer no to any of the following you need to attend this session. 
- Do you source control your models? 
- Do you test your models? 
- Is the percentage of models deployed in production less than 10 per cent? 
- Did you deploy the model?

In this session I will show you how to apply DevOps practices to speed up your development cycle and ensure that you have robust deployable models. We will focus on the Azure cloud platform in particular, however this is applicable to other cloud platforms. 

## Required audience experience
A background in machine learning. This is only 45-60 minutes. There is a lot to cram in. I will assume you know a bit about Machine learning. We will not build a model in this talk, we will deploy a model I built already. 

## Objective of the talk
To show data scientists some of the core aspects of good code development that they can apply to their own models to allow them to get models deployed quicker.
